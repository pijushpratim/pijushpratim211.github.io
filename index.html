I am a math PhD student at Simon Fraser University working under the supervision of [Katrina Honigs](https://www.sfu.ca/~khonigs/). I am broadly interested in Algebraic Geometry. Before starting my PhD, I completed my MSc at SFU. My MSc thesis was on Jacobians of Curves in Abelian Surfaces. Prior to that I completed MMath at Indian Statistical Institute Bangalore and BSc at Tezpur University.
